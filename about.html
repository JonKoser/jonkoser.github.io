                <p class="lead about_text">Hello! I'm Jon and I currently work as a Quality Assurance specialist at Epic in 
                    Verona Wisconsin. I am a recent graduate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I double majored 
                    in Geography and Cartography/GIS. My passions lie in a lot of different places, spanning both technical endeavors
                    (like programming and GIS technologies) and less-technical domains 
                    (like culture and music). I live in wonderful Madison, Wisconsin and am a huge fan of kayaking, running,
                    eating, and hanging around with my dog and fiancee. I've also been known to sing and play guitar, trumpet, and cello.</p>   
                <br>
                <p class="lead about_text">You might be asking: "Jon, how did you end up working a job which seemingly has nothing
                    to do with your major at the largest health care software provider in the world?" Well, let me tell you my story.</p>
                    <br><br>
                <h3>College</h3>
                <p class="lead about_text">I've been fascinated by different places, their cultures and their landscapes, for as long as I can remember. 
                    I grew up being a relatively brainy kid so when I went to college, I decided that I wanted to do something that 
                    would make me a lot of money: become a pharmacist. It didn't take long though before I found that Chemistry at a 
                    higher level did little to hold my attention and so, after a brief existential crisis, I turned back to the things 
                    I knew I loved: maps and the all the wonders they so elegantly describe. Along the way, I also discovered that I had 
                    a fondness for computers and programming, which was the perfect segway into the wide world of Geographic Information Systems. 
                    I found GIS to be a thrillingly applicable way to apply my knowledge as a Geographer to real-world problems. It 
                    really is amazing how versitile and powerful GIS can be and it's exciting to be part of that. During my studies I
                    had the privalege of attending the <a href="http://nacis.org/">North American Cartographic Information Society</a> conference in Pittsburgh which was a 
                    great introduction to how widespread and versitile cartography could really be. I also had the honor of working in the
                    <a href="http://www.geography.wisc.edu/cartography/">UW-Madison Cartography Lab</a> where I was able to actually be a cartographer for over a year. I learned many things
                    in that job and loved working there while honing my craft. Although I truly loved my field of study and the world of
                    Cartography and GIS, after graduation I decided that it might be an adventure to try something new. That's when I came
                    upon Epic. </p>
                    <br>
                <h3>Out of School</h3>
                <p class="lead about_text">One of the things that I learned I had a passion for in school was software. Not just any software
                but <i>good</i> software. Through my study of web and interactive cartography I became increasingly familiar and
                interested with the concepts of user experience and user interface. By joining Epic as a Quality Assurance specilist not only was
                I able to apply my knowledge and passion for UI/UX by being able to have a direct impact on how Epic's sofware looks, feels,
                and operates, but I was also introduced into a industry that I have had an interest in for some time - healthcare. It's both 
                exciting and meaningful working for a company that plays such a big role in the well-being of so many people. It's not only
                a fun job (with great food!), it's a venture into an industry I never thought I'd be able to participate in.</p>
